# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- The variables/coefficients that provided a non random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset are intercept, vehicle length & ground clearance as they have the smallest Pr(>|t|) values.  The smaller the Pr(>|t|) value the less probability that each coefficient contributes a random amount of variance to the linear model.

- The slope of the linear model is not 0. With the significance of our p-value being much smaller than our assumed significant level of 0.05% the slope of the linear model is not zero and we can reject the null hypothesis.

-  The linear model predict mpg of the MechaCar prototypes effectively?  why/whynot
