## Overview

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- The variables/coefficients that provided a non random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset are intercept, vehicle length & ground clearance as they have the smallest Pr(>|t|) values.  The smaller the Pr(>|t|) value the less probability that each coefficient contributes a random amount of variance to the linear model.

- The slope of the linear model is/isnt 0 (why/whynot)
- The linear model predict mpg of the MechaCar prototypes effectively?  why/whynot
